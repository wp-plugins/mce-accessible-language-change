Adds language change button in the WordPress WYSIWYG editor. (WCAG, BITV)

== Description ==
Adds language change button in the WordPress WYSIWYG editor. (WCAG, BITV)

A very light weight plug-in for inserting language change. The button will
be added in the first row of the editor.

Just highlight the word or phrase or insert the cursor in the text, then click on the language button.
Fill out the form:

* Add the appropriate language code for the phrase or text (e.g. 'fr' for a french word or phrase)
* Only for links: Add the appropriate language code for the link target (e.g. 'fr' for a french word or phrase)
* If you want to delete lang attributes, activate the checkbox. But you can just empty the language code field.

Click "OK" and you get the the following:

* If you just inserted the cursor in the text, you get a lang attribute for the parent element.
* If you highlight a word or phrase, you get a span element with lang attribute surrounding the selected text.
* For links you get a lang attribute and in case a href lang attribute.

The plugin is localized for english and german; please let me know if you would like additional
localizations added.

**Note**

If your WP Version is **under 3.9** you have to download plugin version **1.2.** in [downloads](http://wordpress.org/plugins/mce-accessible-language-change/download/).
Version 1.2. does not work properly in IE.

== Installation ==
1. Upload `mce-accessible-language-change` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress
3. To show your language change in a visual way in the editor - not on your website:

   You have to do nothing - the file in css > changelang.css will do everything for you.

   If you can not see any visual change, you probably have a file named editor-styles.css in your WordPress theme.
   If you have already an file named editor-style.css in your theme, you have to copy the styles below into your editor-styles.css to get your language changes visible in the editor.

CSS styles to add:

`[lang] {
     background: #f8f8f8;
     border: 1px solid #d2d0ce;
     padding: 2px;
 }

 a[hreflang] {
     background: #f8f8f8;
     border: 1px solid #d2d0ce;
     border-right: 5px solid #BF8EC8;
     padding: 2px;
     color: #9C2E16;
 }
